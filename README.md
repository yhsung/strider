## Overview

Strider is a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how to accelerate common log-parsing tasks using hardware-level parallelism (SIMD instructions).

### Key Features

- **Multi-Arch Support**: Unified interface for x86_64 (AVX2/AVX-512) and ARM64 (NEON)
- **Vectorized Search**: Uses SIMD instructions to scan megabytes of log data in a single pass
- **Zero-Copy**: Designed for data-oriented workflows to minimize memory overhead
- **Header-Only**: Minimal runtime overhead with compile-time optimization
- **Test-Driven**: Every feature developed using Red-Green-Refactor cycle

## Performance Targets

- **Newline scanning:** >10 GB/s on modern CPUs
- **Pattern matching:** 5-8x faster than `strstr`
- **Log parsing:** Process 1M lines/sec on single core

## Building

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.15+
- GCC 9+ or Clang 10+
- AVX2 support (x86_64) or NEON (ARM64)

### Build Steps

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build .
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration across multiple platforms:

**Test Matrix:**
- **Linux**: GCC & Clang (Debug & Release)
- **macOS**: Apple Silicon ARM64
- **Windows**: MSVC (Debug & Release)
- **Sanitizers**: AddressSanitizer & UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
- **Coverage**: Line coverage tracking with lcov

All tests must pass on all platforms before merging. The CI runs automatically on:
- Every push to `main` or `develop`
- Every pull request
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Dynamic Badges:**
The test and coverage badges automatically update on every CI run. See [docs/DYNAMIC_BADGES.md](docs/DYNAMIC_BADGES.md) for setup instructions.

## Development Approach

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

1. **RED**: Write a failing test
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve while keeping tests green

See [DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md](docs/plans/DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md) for the complete 12-week roadmap.
